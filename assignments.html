    <dd>The difficulty here was choosing a host.  Since I didn&sbquo;t register with the program, I&sbquo;m not (apparently) granted a DoIT portfolio space by the university as described in the policy document, so I had to go with a third party. I&sbquo;ve used a godaddy server forever, but since I've been trying to learn more about git, I decided to use github instead.</dd>
