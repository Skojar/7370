<h1>Level Up</h2>

  <p>When you <strong>have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level+7</strong>, you can reflect on your experiences and hone your skills.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Subtract your current level+7 from your XP.</li>
    <li>Increase your level by 1.</li>
    <li>Choose a new advanced move from your class.</li>
    <li>If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your spellbook.</li>
    <li>Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores canâ€™t go higher than 18.</li>
  </ul>
