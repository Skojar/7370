<h1>Recover</h2>

<p>When you <strong>do nothing but rest in comfort and safety</strong> after a day of rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one debility of your choice. If youâ€™re under the care of a healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.</p>
