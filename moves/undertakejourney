<h1>Undertake a Perilous Journey</h2>

  <p>When you <strong>travel through hostile territory</strong>, choose one member of the party to act as <em>trailblazer</em>, one to <em>scout</em> ahead, and one to be <em>quartermaster</em>. Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis. ✴On a 10+:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by one</li>
    <li>the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much)</li>
    <li>the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on it</li>
  </ul>
  <p✴On a 7–9, each role performs their job as expected: the normal number of rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long as expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either.</p>
<hr />

<p>You can’t assign more than one job to a character. If you don’t have enough party members, or choose not to assign a job, treat that job as if it had been assigned and the responsible player had rolled a 6.</p>

<p>Distances in Dungeon World are measured in rations. A ration is the amount of supplies used up in a day. Journeys take more rations when they are long or when travel is slow.</p>

<p>A perilous journey is the whole way between two locations. You don’t roll for one day’s journey and then make camp only to roll for the next day’s journey, too. Make one roll for the entire trip.</p>

<p>This move only applies when you know where you’re going. Setting off to explore is not a perilous journey. It’s wandering around looking for cool things to discover. Use up rations as you camp and the GM will give you details about the world as you discover them.</p>
