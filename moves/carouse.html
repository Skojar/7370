<h1>Carouse</h2>

<div
  <p>When you <Strong>return triumphant and throw a big party</Strong>, spend 100 coins and roll +1 for every extra 100 coins spent. ✴On a 10+, choose 3. ✴On a 7–9, choose 1. ✴On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand (the GM will say how).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You befriend a useful NPC.</li>
    <li>You hear rumors of an opportunity.</li>
    <li>You gain useful information.</li>
    <li>You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="last">You can only carouse when you return triumphant. That’s what draws the crowd of revelers to surround adventurers as they celebrate their latest haul. If you don’t proclaim your success or your failure, then who would want to party with you anyway?</p>
