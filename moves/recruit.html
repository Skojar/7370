<h1>Recruit</h2>

  <p>When you <Strong>put out word that you’re looking to hire help</Strong>, roll: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>+1 if you make it known that your pay is generous</li>
    <li>+1 if you make it known what you’re setting out to do</li>
    <li>+1 if you make it known that they’ll get a share of whatever you find</li>
    <li>+1 if you have a useful reputation around these parts</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="last">✴On a 10+, you’ve got your pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice who you hire, no penalty for not taking them along. ✴On a 7–9, you’ll have to settle for someone close to what you want or turn them away. ✴On a miss someone influential and ill-suited declares they’d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a loose-cannon, or a veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the consequences or turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1 forward to recruit.</p>
