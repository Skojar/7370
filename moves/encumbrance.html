<h1>Encumbrance</h2>

  <p>When you <Strong>make a move while carrying weight</Strong> you may be encumbered. If your weight carried is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Equal to or less than your load, you suffer no penalty</li>
    <li>Less than or equal to your load+2, you take -1 ongoing until you lighten your burden</li>
    <li>Greater than your load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail</li>
  </ul>
<hr />

<p>A PC’s load stat is determined by their class and Str. Being able to haul more is a clear benefit when trying to carry treasure out of a dungeon or just making sure you can bring along what you need.</p>

<p>This move only applies to things a person could walk around with and still act. Carrying a boulder on your back is not encumbrance—you can’t really act or move much with it. It affects what moves you can make appropriately in the fiction.</p>
